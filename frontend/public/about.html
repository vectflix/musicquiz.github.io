  <h1>About VECTFLIX</h1>
  <p>VECTFLIX is a premium, high-speed music recognition platform engineered by @vecteezy_1 for a global community of audiophiles. Our mission is to provide a seamless, low-latency environment where users can test their musical knowledge against a massive global database in real-time. By leveraging the VECTFLIX Peak Audio Engine, we deliver high-fidelity track previews and instant scoring, bridging the gap between casual listening and competitive gaming through a sleek, minimalist interface.</p>
  <p>To begin your experience, search for any global artist using the integrated search bar. Once an artist is selected, our engine will optimize the audio catalog during a mandatory 5-second buffer to ensure lag-free play. You will face 10 high-intensity rounds where you must identify the correct track title from the audio clip provided. Every correct guess increases your standing. After the final round, you can finalize your score and see where you rank on the Global Hall of Fame.</p>
