  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>Privacy is a core pillar of the VECTFLIX experience. We prioritize user integrity by operating on a no-data-collection model. We do not require emails, passwords, or personal identifiers. Your chosen nickname is stored locally on your device to maintain your session, and competitive scores are transmitted via secure, encrypted protocols to our Render-hosted API solely for leaderboard placement. We never sell, track, or share your personal activity with third parties.</p>
  <p>VECTFLIX utilizes essential cookies and local storage technologies to ensure the platform operates at peak performance. These cookies are used to cache game states, preserve your high scores, and optimize audio buffering speeds. Additionally, we integrate Google AdSense, which may utilize non-personalized cookies to serve relevant advertisements. These ads allow us to keep the VECTFLIX engine free for all users. By continuing to use the platform, you consent to these high-speed data caching technologies.</p>
